# CIFAR-10 Dataset classification using ResNet18
This is a deep learning project where we replicate the ResNet18 architecture to classify images from the public dataset cifar-10. 

## Results 
We could achieve 85% on the test set in 30 epoch while using Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss as optimizer and criterion respectively.
